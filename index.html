            </div>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b> Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> was the founder of the Maratha Empire in
                western India. He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of
                his exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji
                Maharaj carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became the
                genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji Maharaj implemented a competent and
                progressive administration with the help of a disciplined military and well-established administrative
                set-up.</p>
